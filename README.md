# blockchain_eVoting
This is a final project done in the course "Introductio to Cryptographic Currencies" in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
The project was done together with Gili Lior. 

In this project we designed and implemented an e-voting system which is based on a dedicated blockchain, and using an Ethereum smart contract. The system is simulated via a python script which connect to a local Etherum blockchain running using Ganache.
